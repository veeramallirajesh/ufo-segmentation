## This is a Stremlit application.
The aim of this application is to get segmentation mask from the TorchScript model for the new test images.
If the predicted mask looks good enough save the mask to a directory and can be used as a ground-truth for the future training.
Therefore, with proper selection one could increase the training set of data.
