Semantic Segmentation of Aquatic Organisms in Underwater Videos

This project is to develop a Binary Semantic Segmentation model to segment fishes in the Underwater Videos.
The idea is to analyze the Biomass of fishes in the oceans and sea's with the help of this segmentation approach.

Deep Learning Framework : PyTorch.
Models for comparision : UNET, PspNet, DeepLabV3
